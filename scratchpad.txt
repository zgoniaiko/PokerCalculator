click by deck card should try to set hand card and make deck button disabled
in case hand can't accept card, deck should try to set table card and make deck button disabled
in case card wasn't been accepted by hand or table, deck nutton should be left enabled


cards on hand or on table should be disabled on deck panel


hand panel should be synced with model of hand

cardButton = new CardButton() and cardButton.updateIcon() should run together
possible ways to fix it? Factory method? Builder?
